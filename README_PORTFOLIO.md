Portfolio (Futuristic Single Page)

Files added:
- `portfolio.html` — single page HTML
- `styles/futuristic.css` — design and responsive styles
- `scripts/futuristic.js` — small JS for reveals and smooth scroll

Quick test:

Open the page locally in your browser:

```powershell
start .\portfolio.html
```

Notes & customization:
- Replace `resume.pdf` with your actual resume file in the project root.
- Update GitHub links on each project card to point to real repositories.
- Images can be added and referenced inside `.device-card` or project cards as desired.
- Tweak color variables in `styles/futuristic.css` under `:root` for brand colors.

If you want, I can:
- Integrate this into your main `index.html` replacing the existing layout,
- Add project modals and live previews,
- Generate a downloadable `resume.pdf` sample, or
- Optimize images and add icons.
